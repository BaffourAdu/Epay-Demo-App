## About Epay

Epay is a payment service that makes it easier for African businesses to securely accept online payments (both local and International) without coding or having a website and at no cost.

With Epay, a business through a payment page can accept payments from mobile money wallets, Credit or Debit Cards with the lowest transaction fees possible. When a business receives payment, the payment is stored in a wallet provided by Epay for the business and at anytime can be transferred to the business's preferred bank account or mobile money wallet.


## Who can use Epay?

There are a lot of use cases as Epay makes it super easy to receive payments from customers around the world. Your customers can pay via Visa, Master Card, MTN mobile money (Ghana), Vodafone Cash (Ghana), AirtelTigo mobile money(Ghana) and many more.


## How do I signup?
Epay is currently only available via the web. Head to www.epaygh.com to signup.

## How different is Epay from other services out there?
We are not a payment gateway, we have built the infrastructure around the complexity and taken upon ourselves the risk in connecting multiple payment processors to securely process payments. 
What makes us different? Aside charging the lowest transaction fees, Instant and Free settlements, you don't need to have a website or have to be a developer to be able to accept payments on Epay. It takes 3 simple steps to start accepting payments and plus a business's customers need not to install a mobile application or signup to our service.
We're focused on making it super easy and flexible for Africa Businesses to accept payments starting from Ghana.
